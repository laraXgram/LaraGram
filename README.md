### LaraGram Version 2.0.0 is Under Development!

All infrastructures have been rebuilt.
- Added Container to manage dependencies.
- Added service providers.
- Added Facades.

From now on, LaraGram is developed on a completely flexible structure, where features can be loaded and unloaded through Facades and Providers.

***but this is not the whole story!*** LaraGram can now call itself a ***professional framework***.

Let's not spoil the surprise and reveal the new features. Stay tuned for more updates :')
